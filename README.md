# DatabasesCWGroup2

A databases group project with three classmates for the COMP0022 Databases & Information Management Systems Coursework. 

The coursework had to make use of the Ebay API along with our custom algorithms to find the best deals for products. The data was stored in our own databased stored in an elastic Azure MySQL database. The project makes use of Twilio SendGrid to send automated emails to users for their items as well as Azure WebJobs to update the database every 15 minutes with new contents.
